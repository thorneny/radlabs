						<h4>Job Overview</h4>
						<p>We're looking for someone as excited as we are about removing opacity from the world of startups and private companies. At Radicle, we are looking to help investors* in startups make better decisions by building a community and platform that captures the conversation - insights, opinions, research and analysis - around these companies. We think important decisions deserve more than what is available today: simple ‘facts and figures.’<p>
						<p><i>*We believe anyone who spends time with a startup is an investor - whether you invest your time as a partner, your career as an employee, or your dollars as a professional investor.</i></p>
						<p>As an Intern, you will be responsible for producing research and analysis of startups. You will work with the research team, the data science team, and the founders to determine how and which startups we evaluate and to refine the process and methodology by which we do so.</p>
						<p>If you are interested in what startups do, how they work, why they’re successful (or why not), and have thoughtful opinions, you are the person we are looking for.</p>
						<h4>Roles and Responsibilities</h4>
						<p>You will primarily be responsible for evaluating a startup using a proprietary framework. You will seek specific data and information on a startup, categorize it, analyze it, and help compose a thoughtful and insightful narrative around it.</p>
						<h4>Prior experience & professional qualities</h4>
						<p>We are looking for someone with at least 2 years of experience in an analytical capacity (research, business or corporate development, investment banking, consulting). We are looking for smart, self-starters who want to help build a new business from the ground up.</p>
						<p>As well we want to work with people who possess these qualities:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Intellectual curiosity</li>
							<li>Intellectual horsepower</li>
							<li>Attention to detail</li>
							<li>Strong analytical capabilities</li>
							<li>Interest in / experience with startups</li>
							<li>Hard worker</li>
							<li>Good communicator</li>
							<li>Wants to build something</li>
							<li>Is fun</li>
						</ul>
